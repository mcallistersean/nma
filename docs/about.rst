About the NMA Inventory Project's database
========================================

This site/application was developed and deployed by Sean Mc Allister
(email_, email2_) at the University of Vienna during a 5 week program in
June/July of 2010. The main objective of the program was the training of
curators of the National Museum of Afghanistan in Kabul in the disciplines of
art history, numismatics and also system administration. The latter led to the
development of this database.

People familiar with the situation at the museum will be aware that such a database 
and the necessary server hardware alredy exist. The problem with the
previous solution, which was developed by Zia Afshar, who has left the museum, was
that currently no member of staff was able to provide source code or documentation for
that system, which made it impossible to adapt it to the needs of the museum.

Therefor this rather simplistic system was developed that allows for easy
input of the available inventory sheets in Dari and English.

If you read these lines it might well be that you are working at the museum in
Kabul and the staff has granted you access to the database. This is good news
for me, because it means that my system is actually being used. If you would
care to drop me a short email_ with any suggestions, questions, criticisms, bug reports and
alike I will try to improve the system.
